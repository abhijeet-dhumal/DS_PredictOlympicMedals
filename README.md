# DS_PredictOlympicMedals - Olympics Medal Prediction

This project is a machine learning model hosted on GitHub that predicts the number of medals a country will win at the Olympics based on historical data. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can assist in understanding and forecasting a country's performance in the Olympic Games.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- `data/`: This directory contains the historical CSV data used for training and evaluating the machine learning model. The dataset includes information about various countries' performance in past Olympics, such as the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won.

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation. These notebooks provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the project's workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

- `README.md`: This file you are currently reading, which provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and instructions for running the code.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn (for data manipulation and machine learning)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Other libraries as specified in the project's notebooks or scripts

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies before running the project.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abhijeet-dhumal/DS_PredictOlympicMedals.git
   ```

3. Explore the `notebooks/` directory to understand the project's workflow and steps involved.

5. If necessary, modify or extend the code to suit your specific needs. You can add new features, experiment with different machine learning algorithms, or explore different datasets.

6. Save your cleaned CSV data in the `teams` file or any other location of your choice. Update the necessary code references to reflect the new model locations.

7. Document any changes, improvements, or additions you make to the project, including updating the `README.md` file to reflect the new functionalities or modifications.

## Contributing
